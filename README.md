# Forecasting CO2 Trajectory

Beginning in 1958, regular measurements of atmospheric CO2 levels have been taken at the Mauna Loa Observatory in Hawaii under the guidance of scientist Charles David Keeling. Many interesting conclusions have been drawn about the Co2 data, but most alarmingly, the readings showed a consistent upward trend. The graph displaying both the cyclical nature and upward trajectory of atmospheric Co2 concentrations has come to be known as the Keeling Curve, and it is one of the hallmark findings in understanding man-made impacts on climate change. In this project, we seek to better understand how successful historical models of the Keeling Curve have been. We also generate up-to-date projections of future Co2 concentrations so that we can better understand any past modeling shortcomings and better evaluate the impacts of ongoing carbon-emission reduction efforts going forward.

This group project was conducted in the UC Berkeley MIDS' "Statistical Methods for Discrete Response, Time Series, and Panel Data" course. Due to university policy, I'm unable to share lab code.
