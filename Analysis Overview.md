The following section contains snippets of the analysis as UC Berkeley's policy precludes students from sharing lab code or results.

# Overview

We began this lab by introducing the data, history of the topic, and importance of the analysis. We then conducted a time series-focused EDA on the historical data, including seasonal (pictured below), time series, ACF, and PACF plots.

After data cleaning and EDA, we fit linear, quadratic, polynomial, and ARIMA models to the historical CO2 time series data (known as the Keeling Curve).
